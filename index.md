## About Me
I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate at University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia, where I work within [5G/6G Wireless Communications and IoT Networking Lab](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centres/global-big-data-technologies-centre/our-research/iot-communications-and-networking/5g6g-wireless-communications-and-iot-networking-lab), specifically as part of the [AI for Mobile Edge Networks (AI4MEN) Group](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/research-group), under the supervision of [Prof. Hoang Dinh](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/) and [Prof. Diep Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/view/diep-n-nguyen/).    

Before this, I spent some time at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working as a Research Associate.

In 2025, I received my M.Sc. research degree from UTS, working within the same research group and supervision as my current PhD study.
Before that, in 2023, I obtained my B.Sc. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Vietnam National University-University of Engineering and Technology (VNU-UET), Vietnam, supervised by [Dr. Tran Thi Thuy Quynh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RH6V8ycAAAAJ&hl=vi&oi=ao). 

## Research Interests

Recently, I've been working on **AI reasoning models**, focusing on **Reinforcement Learning Post-Training**. During my time at UTS Australia, I focused on Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning using Homomorphic Encryption and Federated Learning to solve privacy problems in networking systems, including IoT and edge computing. Before this, at VNU-UET, I worked on the application of multimodal AI to blockchain security, with a focus on cyberattack detection at both the network layer and bytecode-level of the Ethereum system.
