## About Me
I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate at University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia, where I work within [5G/6G Wireless Communications and IoT Networking Lab](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centres/global-big-data-technologies-centre/our-research/iot-communications-and-networking/5g6g-wireless-communications-and-iot-networking-lab), specifically as part of the [AI for Mobile Edge Networks (AI4MEN) Group](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/research-group), under the supervision of [Prof. Hoang Dinh](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/) and [Prof. Diep Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/view/diep-n-nguyen/).    

Before this, I spent some time at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working as a Research Associate.

In 2025, I received my M.Sc. research degree from UTS, working within the same research group and supervision as my current PhD study.
Before that, in 2023, I obtained my B.Sc. degree from VNU-UET, Vietnam, majoring in electronics and wireless communication. 

## Research Interests

Recently, I've been working on **Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning**, focusing on integrating Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC) to emerging deep learning models. Alongside this, I have a strong interest in fundamental deep learning, particularly on **Reinforcement Learning** and **Language Models** from a deeper theoretical perspective.
