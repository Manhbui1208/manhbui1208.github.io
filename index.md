## About Me

I'm currently a Research Associate at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working in [Bio-inspired AI and Robotics (BioRAI) Lab](https://biorailab.github.io/) with [Asst. Prof. Lin Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SReb2csAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Previously, in early 2025, I received my M.Sc. research degree from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia, where I worked within [5G/6G Wireless Communications and IoT Networking Lab](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centres/global-big-data-technologies-centre/our-research/iot-communications-and-networking/5g6g-wireless-communications-and-iot-networking-lab), specifically as part of the [AI for Mobile Edge Networks (AI4MEN) Group](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/research-group), under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Hoang Dinh](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/) and [Assoc. Prof. Diep Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/view/diep-n-nguyen/). 

Before that, in 2023, I obtained my B.Sc. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Vietnam National University-University of Engineering and Technology (VNU-UET), Vietnam, supervised by [Dr. Tran Thi Thuy Quynh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RH6V8ycAAAAJ&hl=vi&oi=ao). 

## Research Interests

Recently, I've been working on **AI reasoning models based on insights from neuroscience**, focusing on **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) Alignment** and **3D Memory for Embodied Agent**. During my time at UTS Australia, I focused on Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning using Homomorphic Encryption and Federated Learning to solve privacy problems in networking systems, including IoT and edge computing. Before this, at VNU-UET, I worked on the application of multimodal AI to blockchain security, with a focus on cyberattack detection at both the network layer and bytecode-level of the Ethereum system.
